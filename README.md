# Slideshare-to-PDF

This program is designed to scrape a Slideshare presentation and convert the slides to a single PDF file. It uses the Python modules requests, BeautifulSoup, and PIL to download the images, parse the HTML, and create the PDF file. The program uses the validators module to validate the user-provided URL, and the pathlib module to determine the current working directory and the file path for the downloaded PDF. The user interface is created with tkinter. The program includes input validation and error handling, and provides feedback to the user via a label in the GUI.
